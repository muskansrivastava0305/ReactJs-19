## -Is React is library or framework?
- React is a JavaScript Library for building user interface.
- React knows only one thing that is to create an awesome UI.
## Why ReactJS?
- React.JS is declarative Because it describes what the UI should look like rather than now to achieve it.
- This makes the code easier to read and maintain as it is more focoused on the end result rather than the step involved in getting there.
> React-Declarative

```JavaScript
function MyComponnet ({name}){
    return <div> Hello,{name}!<div>;
}
```
> JS-Imperative
```JavaScript
function MyComponent(name){
    const element = document.createElement('div');
    element.textContent=`Hello, ${name}!`;
    return element;
}
```
- Here, we are manually creating elements, setting their properties, and appending them to the DOM.
